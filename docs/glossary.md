# 7 Glossary

- Address, addr: a tuple containing an `IP address` and `port number` in the form (`IP`, `port`).

- Advanced Encryption Standard (`AES`): `AES` is a symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure sensitive data.

- Application Programming Interface (`API`): An `API` is a software interface allowing for two or more computer programs or components to communicate.

- Asymmetric Encryption: Asymmetric Encryption is a cryptographic technique where a pair of keys (a public and private key) are used for encryption and decryption. Messages encrypted with a given key pair's public key can only be decrypted with the respective private key (and visa versa).

- CRC-32: `CRC-32` is a 32-bit checksum based on the data content of a given object.

- Checksum: A checksum is a value calculated from a data packet using some mathematical algorithm such that the same data input always yields the same checksum. The checksum is used to validate data integrity after transmission to ensure no corruption has occurred.

- Constant (`CONST`): A constant is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of a program.

- Daemon: A daemon is a background process. Daemons will typically run continuously until stopped and operate silently, without direct user interaction.

- Diffie-Hellman (`DH`): Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm used to create a shared secret key between two parties. It allows the parties to agree on a secret key without the need to explicitly share the key over some communication channel.

- Distinguished Encoding Rules (`DER`): `DER` is a standard for encoding data structures into binary form for transmission or storage. It is a more restrictive variant of BER that ensures, among other things, that the shortest possible length encoding is used.

- Docker: Docker is a platform for creating and managing containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone and portable environments that typically package an application with its required dependencies.

- Elliptic-curve (`EC`): Elliptic-curve is a form of asymmetric cryptography based on the structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.

- Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (`ECDH`): `ECDH` is a form of Diffie-Hellman that utilizes Elliptic-curve keys.

- Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (`ECDHE`): `ECDHE` is the ephemeral form of `ECDH`. `ECHDE` provides forward security by generating a new ephemeral key pair for each session thus yielding a unique secret key.

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (`ERD`): An `ERD` is a `UML` representation of data models, their attributes and the relationships between them in a database.

- Enum: An enum is a data type that consists of a set of named values with a distinct constant value.

- Exception: An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the typical flow of instructions (i.e. an error).

- Flask: Flask is a micro-web framework package for Python.

- Git: Git is a source control system that tracks changes (and blame) for a given set of computer files.

- GitHub: GitHub is a developer platform providing cloud storage and management of Git projects.

- Global Interpreter Lock (`GIL`): The `GIL` is a mechanism used to ensure that only one thread executes bytecode at any given time.

- Hash-based Message Authentication Code (`HMAC`): `HMAC` is a type of message authentication code that involves the combination of a cryptographic hash function and a secret key to generate a unique code.

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (`HTTP`): `HTTP` is a networking, application layer, protocol for distributed hypermedia information systems. `HTTP` provides the foundation for data communication on the World Wide Web.

- JSON Web Token (`JWT`): `JTW` is a standard for creating data with, optional signature and/or encryption, whose payload contains some `JSON` value typically asserting some number of claims (e.g. username is foo).

- JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`): `JSON` is a data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. Despite its namesake, `JSON` is platform agnostic.

- Mutex: A mutex is a programming construct used to prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.

- MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system (`RDBMS`).

- Private Key: The private key is one-half of the asymmetric key pair and is kept secret.

- Public Key: The public key is one-half of the asymmetric key pair and is freely distributed.

- Python: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

- Queue: A queue is a First-In-First-Out (`FIFO`) data structure.

- Race Condition: In concurrent programming, a race condition arises when the outcome of a program is affected by the unpredictable timing of multiple threads accessing a shared resource.

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (`RSA`): `RSA` is a form of asymmetric cryptography that utilizes the factorization of large integers.

- SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy is a `SQL` toolkit and object-relational-mapper (`ORM`) for Python.

- Session Key: A session key is a temporary cryptographic key used for encryption and decryption during a specific communication session between two parties.

- Symmetric Encryption: Symmetric Encryption is a cryptographic technique where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.

- Thread: A thread is a lightweight process that can execute independently and concurrently with other threads in the same process.

- Transmission Control Protocol (`TCP`): `TCP` is a networking, transport layer, protocol that enables connection-based communication. It provides reliable, ordered and error-checked packet transmission.

- Try/Except Block: A try/except block is a mechanism used for exception handling. Any exceptions raised during the try block will be checked against the exception(s) defined in the except block. If the raised exception matches any of the defined exceptions, the exception is caught and not raised any further.

- Unified Modeling Language (`UML`): `UML` is a general-purpose visual modelling language for use with system design.

- User Datagram Protocol (`UDP`): `UDP` is a networking, transport layer, protocol that enables connectionless communication. It prioritizes speed over reliability and, as such, is unreliable and unordered.

- Visual Studio Code (`VS Code`): Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor.

- X.509: `X.509` is a standard format for certificates allowing for signing with an asymmetric key. A `X.509` will typically also contain some information about the identity of the author.

- Zlib: Zlib is a software library used for data compression.
